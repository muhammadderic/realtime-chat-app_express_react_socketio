<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Chat applications basically allow two-way communication, both individual to individual, individual to group, or group to group. This application enables the full basic functionality of a chat application, namely that users can enter certain rooms and communicate with users in that room, but users will not know about conversations between users in other rooms.
